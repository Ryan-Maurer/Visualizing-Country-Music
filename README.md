## "Country music is gone - and it's not coming back."- Alan Jackson

As someone who is relatively ignorant of country music and its history, I have many times been exposed to the notion that country music has evolved into something very different, if not contrary, from what it was during its "Golden Era".
[^1]
While some people making this observation are simply concerned about the incorporation of modern digital elements, I think that many people view country music's place in today's musical landscape as being very different from where it was during the mid-twentieth century.
A common complaint involves increasing overlap between it and pop music, even incorporating elements from rap and hip hop as well.  This growing trend is in opposition to Golden Era country music, where its place in the musical landscape was (presumably) more carved out and distinct.
While I have no wish to judge whether I agree with this sentiment, nor voice preference of one form of music over another, I thought that it would be interesting to investigate this claim visually using data analysis techniques.
