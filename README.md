# "Country music is gone - and it's not coming back." - Alan Jackson

As someone who is relatively ignorant to country music and its history, I have nevertheless many times over been exposed to the notion that country music has evolved into something very different, if not contrary, from what it was during its "Golden Era".

While some people making this observation are concerned about the incorporation of modern digital elements, I think many people view country music in today's socio-cultural space as being very different from where it was during the mid-twentieth century.
