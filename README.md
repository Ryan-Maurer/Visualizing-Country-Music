# "Country music is gone - and it's not coming back."  - Alan Jackson

As someone who is relatively ignorant to country music and its history, I have nevertheless been exposed many times over the notion that country music has evolved into something very different, if not contrary, from what it was during its "Golden Era".
[^1]: "Golden Era" generally referring the period bewteen the 50's and 60's when the likes of Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, and Merle Haggard dominated the charts. 
While some people making this observation are concerned about the incorporation modern digital elements into their favorite genre, I think many people see where country music stands in today's socio-cultural space as very different from where it did in the mid-twentieth century.
